# FluoroSNNAP

I am attempting to update the FluoroSNNAP software that was created some years back. 
So far I have updated a few pieces of code using MATLAB 2023a and it seems to work with 
the example provided.

The .tif files need to be large (> 20 frames), although I am not perfectly certain because I still have to doo some tests.
